It's become clear that people want to talk about Valkey and have been publishing blog posts/articles fervently.
Here you'll find a collection of all the post I'm aware of in the last few weeks.

## Percona

The kind folks over at Percona have been on an absolutely legendary streak of posting about Valkey.
They've done a series on data types ([Hashes](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-the-hash-datatype/), [Sorted Sets](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-sets-and-sorted-sets/)), [best](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-configuration-best-practices/) and [not-so-good practices](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-not-so-good-practices/), [getting started](https://www.percona.com/blog/hello-valkey-lets-get-started/), [replication/failover](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-replication-and-auto-failover-with-sentinel-service/), [configurations/persistence](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-configurations-and-persistent-setting-of-the-key-parameters/), and finally their own [Valkey packages for DEB and RPM-based distros](https://www.percona.com/blog/hello-valkey-lets-get-started/).

## Fedora Magazine

Yours truly wrote an article for [Fedora Magazine about using the `valkey-compat-redis` package to move to Valkey](https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-move-from-redis-to-valkey/).

## Community.aws

Ricardo Ferreira put together a [walkthrough of using Valkey with Go on Docker](https://community.aws/content/2fdr6Vg8BiJS8jr8xsuQRRc0MD5/getting-started-with-valkey-using-docker-and-go).

## The New Stack

While Open Source Summit North America was last month, [The New Stack published a blog post about Valkey](https://thenewstack.io/valkey-a-redis-fork-with-a-future/) and accompany interview with project leaders, it's worth a watch and read.

## Presentation: Digging into Valkey

On the subject of Open Source Summit, the talk I gave along side Madelyn Olson, ["Digging into Valkey" was posted as a video](https://youtu.be/3G6QgwIl-xs).

## Valkey Seattle IRL

The [Seattle Valkey Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-valkey/) is holding a [Rust module workshop on June 5th](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-valkey/events/301177195/).
A lot of folks will be in town for the Contributor Summit, so this meet up is bound to  be flush with Valkey experts.
Don't miss it.

## Want to add your tutorial/article/meetup/video to a future roundup?

This is the first in a series of roundups on Valkey content.
The plan is to keep an [draft pull request open on the website GitHub repo](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-io.github.io/issues?q=is%3Adraft+label%3Aroundup-post+) where you can contribute your own content.
