Welcome!
For the inaugural blog post on valkey.io, I’d like to recap the story so far, what to look forward to, and then describe how this blog works.

## How do you describe an open source whirlwind?

I would describe it like this: first [a license change](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13157), the [establishment of PlaceholderKV](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/commit/38632278fd06fe186f7707e4fa099f666d805547#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5), a new name and [formation of Valkey within the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community), [hundreds of code updates](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/compare/redis-7.2.4...7.2.4-rc1) by community members from around the world, and [a release candidate](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/7.2.4-rc1).
All within the span of about three weeks.

## Only the start

Out of this initial flurry of activity emerges a project that is sure to have a long history.
This blog will cover the project over time by describing what’s new, what to look forward to, and how you can explore the full extent of Valkey.

## For the community, with the community

Like the Valkey project itself, this blog is not a singular effort of one company but rather a community effort, [built in the open with full transparency](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-io.github.io/).

## What’s next?

Stay tuned for trip reports from Valkey’s first conferences then information about the first GA release.
It’s only going to get more exciting from here.
