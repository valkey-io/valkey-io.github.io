Exciting times!

I'm pleased to announce that you can start using the first generally available, stable Valkey release today.
Check out the [release page for 7.2.5](/download/releases/v7-2-5).

This release maintains the same protocol, API, return values, and data file formats with the last open source release of Redis (7.2.4).

You can [build it from source](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/7.2.5) or [pull it from Valkey’s official Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey/).
Valkey’s release candidates are available in Fedora and EPEL and the new release will be available once the community updates the packages.
