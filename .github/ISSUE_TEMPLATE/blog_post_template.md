**New Blog Post**

This is an issue created to propose a blog post. Make sure to fill out all the fields so the team can best plan to sequence, edit, and publish your post in a timely manner.
Please replace everything in `[]` before submitting. 

**What is your proposed topic?**
[Please include a 1-2 sentence description of the content of the blog].

**Who is writing this blog post?**


**What is your ideal publishing date?**


(Please provide an actual date; 'ASAP' is not a date. Due to other pending blog posts, review time, and project events, publish dates are best effort, typically allow for 5 business days of review between making a PR and publishing.)

**Is this blog post dependent on something else?**

[Examples: the blog post needs to be published before an event, the blog post publishing date depends on a software release date, etc.]
