If you use keys with limited time to live (Valkey expires) this is normal behavior. This is what happens:

* The primary generates an RDB file on the first synchronization with the replica.
* The RDB file will not include keys already expired in the primary but which are still in memory.
* These keys are still in the memory of the Valkey primary, even if logically expired. They'll be considered non-existent, and their memory will be reclaimed later, either incrementally or explicitly on access. While these keys are not logically part of the dataset, they are accounted for in the `INFO` output and in the `DBSIZE` command.
* When the replica reads the RDB file generated by the primary, this set of keys will not be loaded.

Because of this, it's common for users with many expired keys to see fewer keys in the replicas. However, logically, the primary and replica will have the same content.
