The Valkey community is proud to unveil the first release candidate of Valkey 8.0,
a major update designed to enhance performance, reliability, and observability 
for all Valkey installations. In this blog, we'll dive a bit deeper into each of these 
areas and talk about the exciting features we've built for this release.

## Performance

Valkey 8.0 features significant improvements to the existing I/O threading system,
allowing the main thread and I/O threads to operate concurrently. This release also
includes a number of improvements to offload work to the I/O threads and introduces
efficient batching of commands. Altogether, Valkey 8.0 is designed to handle up to
1.2 million Queries Per Second (QPS) on AWS's r7g platform, compared to the previous
limit of 380K QPS. We'll dive deeper into these numbers in an upcoming blog.

NOTE: Not all improvements are available in the release candidate, but they will
be available in the GA release of Valkey 8.0.

- **Asynchronous I/O Threading**: Enables parallel processing of commands and
  I/O operations, maximizing throughput and minimizing bottlenecks.
- **Intelligent Core Utilization**: Distributes I/O tasks across multiple
  cores based on realtime usage, reducing idle time and improving energy efficiency.
- **Command Batching**: Optimizes memory access patterns by prefetching frequently
  accessed data to minimize CPU cache misses, reducing memory accesses required for
  dictionary operations.

For more details on these improvements, you can refer to
[#758](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/758) and
[#763](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/763).

## Reliability

Cluster scaling operations via slot migrations have historically been delicate.
Valkey 8.0 improves reliability and minimizes disruptions with the following
enhancements:

- **Automatic Failover for Empty Shards**: New shards that start empty, owning
  no slots, now benefit from automatic failover. This ensures high availability
  from the start of the scaling process.
- **Replication of Slot Migration States**: All `CLUSTER SETSLOT` commands are
  now replicated synchronously to replicas before execution on the primary. This
  reduces the chance of unavailability if the primary fails, as the replicas have
  the most up-to-date information about the state of the shard. New replicas also
  automatically inherit the state from the primary without additional input from
  an operator.
- **Slot Migration State Recovery**: In the event of a failover, Valkey 8.0 automatically
  updates the slot migration states on source and target nodes. This ensures requests
  are continuously routed to the correct primary in the target shard, maintaining
  cluster integrity and availability.

For more details on these improvements, you can refer to
[#445](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/445).

## Replication

Valkey 8.0 introduces a dual-channel replication scheme, allowing the RDB and
the replica backlog to be transferred simultaneously, accelerating synchronization.

- **Reduced Memory Load**: By streaming replication data to the replica during
  the full sync, the primary node experiences significantly less memory pressure.
  The replica now manages the Client Output Buffer (COB) tracking, reducing the
  likelihood of COB overruns and enabling larger COB sizes on the replica side.
- **Reduced Parent Process Load**: A dedicated connection for RDB transfer frees
  the primary's parent process from handling this data, allowing it to focus on
  client queries and improving overall responsiveness.

Performance tests show improvements in write latency during sync, and in scenarios
with heavy read commands, the sync time can be cut by up to 50%. This translates
to a more responsive system, even during synchronization.

For more details on these improvements, you can refer to [#60](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/60).

## Observability

Valkey 8.0 introduces a comprehensive per-slot metrics infrastructure, providing
detailed visibility into the performance and resource usage of individual slots.
This granular data helps inform decisions about resource allocation, load
balancing, and performance optimization.

- **Key Count**: Returns the number of keys in each slot, making it easier to
  identify the slots with the largest number of keys.
- **CPU Usage**: Tracks CPU time consumed by operations on each slot, identifying
  areas of high utilization and potential bottlenecks.
- **Network Input/Output Bytes**: Monitors data transmission and reception by
  each slot, offering insights into network load and bandwidth utilization.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Initial benchmarks show that enabling detailed metrics
  incurs a negligible overhead of approximately 0.7% in QPS.

For more details on these improvements, you can refer to [#712](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/712),
[#720](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/720), and [#771](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/771).

## Efficiency

Valkey 8.0 introduces two new improvements that reduce the memory overhead of keys,
allowing users to store more data without any application changes.
The first change is that keys are now embedded in the main dictionary, eliminating separate
key pointers and significantly reducing memory overhead. This results in a 9-10%
reduction in overall memory usage for scenarios with 16-byte keys and 8 or 16-byte
values, along with performance improvements.

This release also introduces a new per-slot dictionary for Valkey cluster, which
replaces a linked list that used to allow operator to list out all the keys in
a slot for slot-migration. The new architecture splits the main dictionary by slot,
reducing the memory overhead by 16 bytes per key-value pair without degrading performance. 

For more details on these improvements, you can refer to [#541](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/541)
and [Redis#11695](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11695).

## Additional Highlights

- **Dual IPv4 and IPv6 Stack Support**: Seamlessly operate in mixed IP environments
  for enhanced compatibility and flexibility.
  See [#736](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/736) for details.
- **Improved Pub/Sub Efficiency**: Lightweight cluster messages streamline
  communication and reduce overhead for faster, more efficient Pub/Sub operations.
  See [#654](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/654) for details.
- **Valkey Over RDMA (Experimental)**: Unlock significant performance improvements
  with direct memory access between clients and Valkey servers, delivering up to
  275% increase in throughput.
  See [#477](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/477) for details.
- **Numerous Smaller Performance/Reliability Enhancements**: Many under-the-hood
  improvements ensure a smoother, more stable experience across the board.
  See [release notes](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/8.0.0-rc1) for details.

## Conclusion

Valkey 8.0 is a major update that offers improved performance, reliability, and
observability. Whether you are an experienced Valkey/Redis user or exploring
it for the first time, this release provides significant advancements in in-memory
data storage. You can try out these enhancements today by downloading from 
[source](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/8.0.0-rc1) or using one 
of our [container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey). We would love 
to hear your thoughts on these new features and what you hope to see in the 
future from the Valkey project.

**Important Note**: The Valkey Over RDMA feature is currently experimental and
might change or be removed in future versions.

We look forward to seeing what you achieve with Valkey 8.0!
