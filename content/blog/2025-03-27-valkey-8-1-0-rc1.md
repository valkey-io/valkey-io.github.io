The Valkey community is proud to unveil the first release candidate of Valkey 8.1,
a minor update designed to further enhance performance, reliability, and observability 
over Valkey 8.0 for all Valkey installations. 
In this blog, we'll dive a bit deeper into each of these areas 
and talk about the exciting features built for this release.

## Performance


## Reliability


## Replication


## Observability


## Efficiency


## Additional Highlights

### Conditional updates

This new functionality allows Valkey users to perform conditional updates using the SET command if the given comparison-value matches the keyâ€™s current value. This is a not only a quality-of-life improvement for developers as they no longer need to add this condition to their application code, it also saves a roundtrip to first get a value and then compare it before a SET. When using the optional GET as part of the SET IFEQ, the existing value is returned regardless whether it matches the comparison-value.

Syntax:

    SET key value [ NX | XX | IFEQ comparison-value ] [ GET ] [ EX seconds | PX milliseconds | EXAT unix-time-seconds | PXAT unix-time-milliseconds | KEEPTTL ]

## Conclusion


We look forward to hearing what you achieve with Valkey 8.1!
