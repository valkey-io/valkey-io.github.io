I sat on the selection committee for Keyspace and was floored by the number and quality of submissions we received.
It's truly amazing to see the talent and depth of experience that is present in the Valkey community manifest in a slate of presentations aimed to interest both experienced and new Valkey users.

The Keyspace 2025 conference is quickly approaching on August 28th, 2025 in Amsterdam so make sure and [register today](/events/keyspace-2025#register) to hear from these experts.
