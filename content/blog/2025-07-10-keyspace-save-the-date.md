Join the Valkey crew on August 28, 2025 in Amsterdam for the first ever Valkey conference: Keyspace!

Keyspace is the event where developers, SREs, and DevOps pros gather to share techniques, best practices, and new uses for Valkey.
Youâ€™ll meet and network with the project maintainers, community enthusiasts, and thought leaders in a focused one-day event.
The event will give insights into the project through general sessions, breakout rooms, lightning talks, and a workshop, in two distinct orbits (aka "tracks" if you want to be boring).  

Breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and exclusive Valkey swag is included.

Keyspace is being held in conjunction with the [Linux Foundation Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) at the [RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre](https://www.rai.nl/en).
Tickets for Open Source Summit are not required to attend Keyspace.

**Want to share _your_ Valkey story?** Date extended! [Submit your talk by July ~24~ 28](https://sessionize.com/keyspace/)!

Tickets available soon.
