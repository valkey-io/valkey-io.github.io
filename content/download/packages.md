You can get Valkey from a variety of package managers in many different operating systems.
In the chart below, the filled dot (⬤) indicates that the Valkey package for the version in the left most column is available for the package manager indicated in the corresponding column header, the unfilled dot (◯) indicates that the package is not yet available.
Some package managers may be used across many different distributions (i.e. EPEL with AlmaLinux, RHEL, Oracle Linux, etc. ) or operating systems (i.e. Homebrew or Nix with MacOS and Linux).

This information is maintained on a best-effort basis, if you believe that it is inaccurate, [create an issue](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-io.github.io/issues/new/choose).
Requests for new packages or updates should go to the relevant process for each package manager.
