Keyspace is the event where developers, SREs, and DevOps pros gather to share techniques, best practices, and new uses for Valkey. Youâ€™ll meet and network with the project maintainers, community enthusiasts, and thought leaders in a focused one-day event. The event will give insights into the project through general sessions, breakout rooms, lightning talks, and a workshop, in two distinct orbits (aka "tracks" if you want to be boring).
