Keyspace is the event where developers, SREs, and DevOps pros gather to share techniques, best practices, and new uses for Valkey. You’ll meet and network with the project maintainers, community enthusiasts, and thought leaders in a focused one-day event. The event will give insights into the project through general sessions, breakout rooms, lightning talks, and a workshop, in two distinct orbits (aka "tracks" if you want to be boring).

## Tentative Schedule

The conference has two orbits: **Orbit A** for those who already know Valkey and are looking to deepen their understanding and **Orbit B** for those who are just starting to get to know Valkey. You're not locked into either orbit, so you can select the right talks for your needs.
