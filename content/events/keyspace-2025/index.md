Keyspace is the event where developers, SREs, and DevOps pros gather to share techniques, best practices, and new uses for Valkey. Youâ€™ll meet and network with the project maintainers, community enthusiasts, and thought leaders in a focused one-day event. The event will give insights into the project through general sessions, breakout rooms, lightning talks, and a workshop, in two distinct orbits (aka "tracks" if you want to be boring).

## Tentative Schedule

The conference has two orbits: **Orbit A** for those who already know Valkey and are looking to deepen their understanding and **Orbit B** for those who are just starting to get to know Valkey. You're not locked into either orbit, so you can select the right talks for your needs.
