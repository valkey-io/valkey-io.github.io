# History of Valkey

Valkey is an open source continuation of Redis, created in March 2023 following Redis's shift to a non-open source license. This initiative was led by Madelyn Olson, a notable figure in the Redis community and a former core maintainer at AWS, along with other contributors who sought to preserve the original open source ethos of Redis. The transition garnered substantial backing from leading tech corporations including AWS, Google, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, with the Linux Foundation stepping in to provide a stable platform for this new direction. Amidst the landscape of Redis alternatives, Valkey stands out with strong support from cloud services providers, positioning it as a promising solution for future open source database needs.
